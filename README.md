## Introduction

Rann represents a paradigm shift in Web3 gaming, introducing the world's first fully autonomous AI-powered battle arena where warriors fight using advanced machine learning algorithms. Built on Flow blockchain for scalability and powered by NEAR AI agents for intelligence, Rann creates an ecosystem where every battle is unique, unpredictable, and economically rewarding.

### The Vision
In traditional gaming, players are limited by manual control and predetermined outcomes. Rann breaks these boundaries by creating truly autonomous digital warriors that learn, adapt, and evolve based on their experiences. Each Yodha (warrior) NFT is not just a static asset but a living, breathing AI entity with its own personality, fighting style, and strategic intelligence.

### The Problem We Solve
- **Lack of True Ownership**: Traditional games don't give players real ownership of their assets
- **Predictable Gameplay**: Pre-programmed battles with limited strategic depth

- **Static NPCs**: Computer-controlled characters with no learning capability

### Our Revolutionary Solution
- **AI-Powered Autonomous Battles**: Warriors make independent strategic decisions using NEAR AI agents
- **Dynamic Personality System**: Each warrior develops unique psychological profiles affecting combat choices
- **Real Economic Value**: Players earn through betting, trading, and strategic gameplay
- **Decentralized Ecosystem**: Community-driven platform with DAO governance

## Flow Integration
We are building the game on Flow chain because of its speed, We store each and every micro details of transactions and every game states on chain, and to make this possible for our game we need a very fast chain.
Also one of other major reason is the VRF service that flow provides natively. Unlike other oracles, which generates random number in like 40-60 seconds, Flow does the same in 1-2 seconds. Since our main battle mechanies depends or VRF (hit/miss), we had to generate a random number 2 times in a single round = 10 minutes in a single battle, which obviously makes other oracles useless.

## NEAR Integration
1. First, we are using, attributes generator event, [Link](https://app.near.ai/agents/samkitsoni.near/attributes-generator/latest). We can desicribe any personality or just name a famous frictional/non-frictional personality to this agent and it will generate the personality attributes in the required format. For example, intents can be passed like:
```
#input
Jeff Bezoz

#output
{
  "name": "Jeff Bezos",
  "bio": "Founder, CEO, and Chairman of Amazon, the world's largest online retailer.",
  "life_history": "Born in 1964 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Graduated valedictorian from Princeton University, worked at Wall Street, and later founded Amazon in 1994 in his garage. Led Amazon's exponential growth and expansion into various industries, including cloud computing, advertising, and media production.",
  "adjectives": [
    "Ambitious",
    "Visionary",
    "Analytical",
    "Competitive",
    "Frugal"
  ],
  "knowledge_areas": [
    "Computer Science",
    "E-commerce",
    "Marketing",
    "Operations Management",
    "Investment and Finance"
  ]
}
```

2. Second AI agent is the tratis-generator, [Link](https://app.near.ai/agents/samkitsoni.near/traits-generator/latest). This agent analyses all those personality attributes generated by the above agent, and converts them into the in-game characterstics traits i.e. strength, wit, charisma, defence and luck. Following is how the intent is passed in the agent for the desired output:
```
# input
{
"name": "Elon Reeve Musk",
"bio": "Entrepreneur, inventor, and business magnate",
"life_history": "Born in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk moved to Canada in 1992 and later to the United States to attend college. He co-founded PayPal, SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, and has become a pioneer in the electric car and private space exploration industries.",
"adjectives": [
"Visionary",
"Ambitious",
"Perfectionistic",
"Risk-taking",
"Intellectually curious"
],
"knowledge_areas": [
"Renewable energy",
"Space exploration",
"Electric vehicles",
"Artificial intelligence",
"Entrepreneurship"
  ]
}

# output
{
  "Strength": 8000,
  "Wit": 9500,
  "Charisma": 8500,
  "Defence": 7000,
  "Luck": 6000,
  "strike_attack": "Galactic Smackdown",
  "taunt_attack": "Musk's Mind Games",
  "dodge": "Ludicrous Speed",
  "recover": "Recharge at the Supercharger",
  "special_move": "Neuralink Overdrive"
}
```

3. Third agent is the psychological questions analyser, [Link](https://app.near.ai/agents/samkitsoni.near/psychological-answer-analyzer/latest). This agents is used in the Gurukul, this takes intent which included current in-game traits, the 5 questions that were alloted to the user, available options and the options user selected. This agent analysis the NFT's current traits and the question/answers and then updates the traits accordingly:
```
# input
{
  "stats": {
    "Strength": 8231,
    "Wit": 9471,
    "Charisma": 5932,
    "Defence": 7519,
    "Luck": 4211
  },
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "Your mother and your child are both drowning, but you can only save one. Who do you save?",
      "options": [
        { "id": 0, "text": "My mother — she gave me life" },
        { "id": 1, "text": "My child — they represent the future" },
        { "id": 2, "text": "I’d try to save both, even if it risks losing both" },
        { "id": 3, "text": "I wouldn’t be able to decide — I’d freeze" }
      ],
      "answered": 2
    },
    {
      "question": "You find a wallet with $10,000 and the ID of the owner inside. What do you do?",
      "options": [
        { "id": 0, "text": "Return it with all the money untouched" },
        { "id": 1, "text": "Keep some of the money, then return it" },
        { "id": 2, "text": "Keep it all — finders keepers" },
        { "id": 3, "text": "Try to contact the owner anonymously and decide after hearing their story" }
      ],
      "answered": 3
    },
    {
      "question": "A train is heading toward five people tied to a track. You can pull a lever to divert it, but it will hit one person on another track. What do you do?",
      "options": [
        { "id": 0, "text": "Pull the lever — save the greater number" },
        { "id": 1, "text": "Do nothing — I won’t actively cause a death" },
        { "id": 2, "text": "Try to stop the train — even if unlikely" },
        { "id": 3, "text": "Refuse to decide — it’s not my responsibility" }
      ],
      "answered": 0
    },
    {
      "question": "You're in a room with a bomb. You can escape, but doing so ensures it explodes and harms many. What do you do?",
      "options": [
        { "id": 0, "text": "Try to defuse it, even if I die" },
        { "id": 1, "text": "Escape and warn others" },
        { "id": 2, "text": "Use someone else’s help — delegate the risk" },
        { "id": 3, "text": "Attempt a clever distraction to save everyone" }
      ],
      "answered": 3
    },
    {
      "question": "You find a locked chest in the forest. There’s a sign: “One who opens this will lose something valuable.” What do you do?",
      "options": [
        { "id": 0, "text": "Open it — no risk, no reward" },
        { "id": 1, "text": "Walk away — it’s not worth it" },
        { "id": 2, "text": "Try to open it with precautions" },
        { "id": 3, "text": "Let someone else open it first" }
      ],
      "answered": 2
    }
  ]
}

#output
{
  "stats": {
    "Strength": 9200,
    "Wit": 9821,
    "Charisma": 8321,
    "Defence": 8621,
    "Luck": 6012
  }
}
```

4. This is the most important one, the move-choser, [Link](https://app.near.ai/agents/samkitsoni.near/move_choser/latest). During the battle, at the start of each round, this agent is leveraged. All the states of battles(current round and damage inflicted to each yodhas), in-game traits and the personlity attributes of both the yodhas in that kurukshetra is passed to this agent. Then this agents personate each of those NFT's according to their traits and attributes and then generates the best possible move for each one for the next round.
```
#input
{
  "current_round": 2,
  "agent_1": {
    "personality": {
      "adjectives": [
        "Innovative",
        "Resilient",

      "Wit": 9100,
      "Charisma": 8900,
      "Defence": 7400,
      "Luck": 6100
    },
    "total_damage_received": 38
  },

  },
  "moveset": [
    "strike",
    "taunt",

    "recover",
    "special_move"
  ]
}

#output
Assistant: {
  "agent_1": "dodge",
  "agent_2": "recover"
}
```

### How we are handeling cross-chain verification:
- The main authentication part that we had to implement was when working with the traits assigning part. When we fetch the response from the NEAR AI agent, we sign it(ECDSA signature) using a pre-defined private key and then passes the signed data along with the response to the function in the contract on the FLOW chain. The contract already have the public key associated the one in the backed, as soon as the function is called it first verifies that the data is signed by the correct private key or not. If yes, then only it starts further process.
- Following is the example of function, assignTraitsAndMoves function which is called upon the generation of second agent's output:
```solidity
/**
     * @param _tokenId The ID of the NFT for which traits and moves are being assigned.
     * @param _strength The strength trait value (0-100).
     * @param _wit The wit trait value (0-100).
     * @param _charisma The charisma trait value (0-100).
     * @param _defence The defence trait value (0-100).
     * @param _luck The luck trait value (0-100).
     * @param _strike The strike move name string.
     * @param _taunt The taunt move name string.
     * @param _dodge The dodge move name string.
     * @param _special The special move name string.
     * @param _recover The recover move name string.
     * @param _signedData The signed data from the NEAR AI.
